# `nimi` dictionary in Rust

A small project I started to learn to use Helix and some Rust stuff. I had to use [[rust-json-request]] -- it's a lot of dependencies to just fetch JSON from an endpoint, but each one is reasonable.

[x] Fetch Linku data [[rust-json-request]]
[ ] Cache Linku data [[rust-directories]]
[ ] Fuzzy search
[ ] Interactive fuzzy search with fzf or a custom solution?
