# Journal - December 24, 2025

- I set up the `zk` daily journal.
- I VC'd with Ethan and played Genshin. I added him as a friend.
- I emailed Dr. Wu to reschedule our next-week meeting time because of my dentist appointment next week.
- For the first time in a while, I interacted in _ma pona pi toki pona_. It was pretty entertaining.
- For dinner, we had lamb and cauliflower and salmon.
- I've just started practicing Brahms's Sonata 2 for clarinet.
- I started writing a command line Toki Pona dictionary in Rust called `nimi`. I'm using `helix` to write it. Hopefully that goes well.
- I played Minecraft with Ethan, and we built an End farm. I'm using tarot cards as the naming basis for my tools and armor.

- I'm still working on [[toki-pona-word2vec]]. Today, I came up with the idea to do [[toki-pona-word2vec-core-common]].
