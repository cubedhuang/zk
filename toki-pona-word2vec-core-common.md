# Toki Pona W2V - Narrow to Core+Common

Maybe the subset that I chose was bad -- what if I look at only core+common? I don't think there is a need to look beyond that since subjectively I don't really see them used often. I think that could "improve" the filtered subset. Same with the words that I choose to plot and categorize.

- I can add an explanation for this: words from the 130 that are often cited by the community to definitively be in use.
